# python-udemy
This is the repo where I will be uploading all my progress from the Udemy Python Masterclass course

This is a test.

### It will mainly use exercises from the Expert Python Manual

<b>Exercise 1</b>
    Covers the very basics of reading/writing from/to a file
    
<b>Exercise 2</b>
    Covers how to create basic webservers with Flask and more advanced ones with Django (see [mysite](/exercise_2_web_development/mysite/))
